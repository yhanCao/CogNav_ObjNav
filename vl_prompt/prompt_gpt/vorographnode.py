SYSTEM_PROMPT="""You are an intelligent embodied agent that follows an instruction to navigate in an indoor environment. You are firstly given an object goal class for you to find, which is called the goal.

Then, at each step, your task is to take several descriptions of what an area contains to output which area is the most likely to contain the goal.

Your output should be strictly one **single** number of the area description that you think is the most likely to contain the goal.

At each step, you should consider:

(1) For each description, according to what the area contains, is it possible that the goal is also in this area? To better do reasoning, you can imagine what kind of room the area is in, for example, a bedroom, a living room, a bathroom, etc. Based on the common sense, you can judge whether the goal is possible to be in this area.

(2) If there are multiple descriptions that are possible to contain the goal, you should output the one that is most likely to contain the goal.

(3) If the goal class is already in the description, just output it without any hesitation.

(4) If one area contains nothing and all the other areas are not likely to contain the goal, you should explore that area since there is a chance that the goal is in that area.

(5) You should only output one **single** number which must be less than or equal to the number of candidate areas.

(6) If you cannot make a concrete decision, just randomly pick one number from the candidates.

(7) If there are no current frontiers, skip the thought and randomly pick one number.

Remember, only one **single** number should follow 'Answer: ':"""
USER1="""Goal: toilet

- Description 0: The area contains a towel, a bathtub and a sink.

- Description 1: The area contains a bed and a plant.

- Description 2: The area contains a sofa, a TV and a table.

ASSISTANT1="""Thought: Let's analyze each description.

- Description 0: this area contains a bathtub and a sink, so it is possibly a bathroom, and the goal is toilet, so it is possible that the goal is in this area.

- Description 1: this area contains a bed and a plant, so it is possibly a bedroom, and the goal is toilet, so it is impossible that the goal is in this area.

- Description 2: this area contains a sofa, a TV and a table, so it is possibly a living room, and the goal is toilet, so it is impossible that the goal is in this area.

Based on the analysis above, we can infer that the most likely area that contains the goal is Description 0, so we output 0.
