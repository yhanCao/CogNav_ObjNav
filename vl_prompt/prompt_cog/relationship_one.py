# You should consider the following rules when discovering the relationship:
# (1)
# (2) You need to analyze semantic information of the input image to give the relationship.
# "on" : if one object in key "id" is an object commonly placed on top of the another one.
# "in" : if one object in key "id" is an object commonly placed inside the another one.
# "next to" : if two objects position in the same plane, close and parallel to each other, and with no remaining objects between them.
# "hanging on" : if one object in key "id" hold onto the another one firmly to avoid falling or losing grip.
# "none" : if none of the above best describe the relationship between the two objects.
# You need to only output a relationship (and nothing else). such as: "on", and don't output the reason.
